# Project 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.

## Experience

* Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
  - I deployed the first honeypot, the honeypot directed at http through Dionaea.
* Any issues you encountered
  - There were countless issues encountered using the command line on the host machine rather than the GCP Dashboard. In some cases, a command had to to run two or three times before it didn't provide an error. In other cases, the only way to progress was to enter the command . Some other steps had to be taken that weren't directly outlined in the instructions but rather were only understood to be necessary after countless efforts, redirection, and rereadings of the instructions until there was an understanding that there was something missing in order to accomplish a step.
