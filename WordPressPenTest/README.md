# Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **three vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

### 1. WordPress <= 4.9.4 - Application Denial of Service (DoS) (unpatched)
  - [ ] **Summary:** An application-level denial of service attack in the WordPress CMS platform possible through a single machine without the need of a massive amount of bandwidth (often seen in network-level DDoS attacks). This vulnerability is unpatched to this day and affects almost all version of WordPress. Much like other Denial of Service attacks, attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to make a site unaccessible to users and therefore, deprive them of its resources.
    - Vulnerability types: Denial of Service
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: (unpatched)

    ![XSS via Image](https://github.com/HaTeMaiL/FacebookCodePathCourse_Authentic8/blob/master/WordPressPenTest/DoS.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
1. Download Python script (doser.py) through the terminal upsing wpget
2. Enter commands to run script and send an overwhelming number of requests to the target site
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [Vulnerable Code](https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=editor,common,user-profile,media-widgets,media-gallery)
    
### 2. WordPress 2.5-4.6 - Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Image Filename
  - [ ] **Summary:** A Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows for an attacker to utilize XSS techniques inthe image file name and when uploaded in WordPress, inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. Attackers can utilize this vulnerability to so a number of malicious acts, such as stealing session tokens or login credentials and then performing actions in their name and with their privileges.
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.10

     ![XSS via Image](https://github.com/HaTeMaiL/FacebookCodePathCourse_Authentic8/blob/master/WordPressPenTest/Image.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate for proof of concept (Must use Linux or Mac OS): 
1. Download or use any image file
2. Rename the image's file name with malicious JavaScript code
3. Upload any image file (needs at minimum Author privileges)
4. View Attachment page
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [Vulnerable Post](http://your-wordpress-site.com/?attachment_id=#)
    - [Security Release](https://wordpress.org/news/2016/09/wordpress-4-6-1-security-and-maintenance-release/)
    
### 3. WordPress 3.6.0-4.7.2 - Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media File Metadata
  - [ ] **Summary:** Two Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the playlist functionality of WordRess that allows for an attacker to exploit them by convincing an Editor or Administrator into uploading a malicious MP3 file. Still, once legitmately uploaded the issues can be triggered by a Contributor or higher using the playlist shortcode.
    - Vulnerability types: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.13

  - [ ] Steps to recreate for proof of concept: 
1. Upload xss.mp3 file (needs at minimum Editor privileges)
2. View Attachment page
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [Vulnerable Post](http://your-wordpress-site.com/?attachment_id=#)
    - [Security Release](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/03/wordpress-4-7-3-security-and-maintenance-release/)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

Getting wpscan to work required Kali to be at its current version. The file image upload XSS attack is not possible through Windows, must use Linux because Windows limits the use of the "<" and ">" characters in filenames. Proof of concepts were often hard to visualize when attempting them.
